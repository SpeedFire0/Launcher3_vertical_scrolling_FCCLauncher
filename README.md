Launcher3 with Vertical Scrolling (FCC Launcher)
=========

В этом проекте я переделал стандартный Launcher3 от Google для скроллинга рабочих столов в вертикальном, а не горизонтальном направлении.

----
**Short Description**
This is an attempt to make Launcher3 from Google to scroll screens vertically rather than horizontally.
The horizontal (original / normal) version was taken from fookwood's repository: https://github.com/fookwood/Launcher3

**Preview**

**Known issues:**
I was able to handle with most of the issues during its conversion to vertical launcher, except for Top/Bottom Edge Effect (the code is located in PagedView and LauncherEdgeEffect files and market with TODO tag). Would be thankful for any help.
